# Getting Started

First of all, create a console project.

![Untitled](Getting%20Started%204c5c292ed729439096ae505bb5469804/Untitled.png)

[Install package from nuget](https://www.nuget.org/packages/TcpServerKit/)

Add following namespaces

```csharp
using TcpServerKit.Core;
using TcpServerKit.Core.Socket;
using System.Net.Sockets;
```

Then initialize server IP and port

```csharp
Server.InitServer("127.0.0.1", 3000);
```

Define two properties for client’s event

```csharp
Server.NewClientJoined += (TcpClient client) =>
{
    Console.WriteLine("new client join");
};
Server.ClientExited += (TcpClient client) =>
{
    Console.WriteLine("client exit");
};
```

Now your server is ready to start, but before that let's add some listeners.

```csharp
Server.AddListener("Login", Login);
```

In this example we add one listener with event name `Login`. After the client sends a message with the same event name, the `Login` task will be run.

```csharp
private Task Login(string data, TcpClient client)
{
 
}
```

`data` is a string data which client sends to the server and `client` is a TcpClient object of who sends it.

Very well. After adding all of the listeners we can start the server.

```csharp
Server.StartServer();
```

There is it. All you need to run your server.

And don’t forget to put a `Console.ReadKey();` To prevent the console from closing.

See the result.

Now we will work with users and rooms. For that, create a new class with name `MyUser` and inherit from `User` then implement constructors. For that we need to import the following namespaces

```csharp
using System;
using System.Net.Sockets;
using TcpServerKit.Core;
 
 
public class MyUser : User
{
  public MyUser()
  {
  }

  public MyUser(TcpClient tcpClient) : base(tcpClient)
  {
  }    
}
```

So, create another class for Room and name it `MyRoom` and inherit from `Room`. Implement constructor and functions.

```csharp
using System.Net.Sockets;
using TcpServerKit.Core;
using TcpServerKit.Core.Tcp;
using TcpServerKit.Manager;
 
 
    public class MyRoom : Room
    {
        public MyRoom(int roundCount) : base(roundCount)
        {
 
        }
 
        public override Task GameCompletedAsync()
        {
            // invoke when game completed
        }
 
        public override Task NewUserJoinedAsync(User user)
        {
            // invoke when new user joined
        }
 
        public override Task RoomReadyForStartAsync(List<User> users)
        {
            // invoke when room ready for start
        }
 
        public override Task RoundStartedAsync(ushort roundId)
        {
            // invoke when new round started
        }
 
        public override Task UserExitedAsync(User user)
        {
            // invoke when an user exit from room or his connection lost
        }
 
        public override Task UserKickedAsync(User user)
        {
            // invoke when an user kicked from room
        }
    }
```

So after creating my classes, we want to create a new `MyUser` object

Declare in the `LoginAsync` task we created earlier.

```csharp
private Task LoginAsync(string data, TcpClient client)
{
  var user = new MyUser(client);

  Console.WriteLine($"new user with UniqueId{user.UniqueId} logined");
  Server.Send(user, "Login", "{ \"result\": true, id: " +
      user.UniqueId + "}");
  return Task.CompletedTask;
}
```

In the first line create the user.

Next line writes a message on the console and shows the user's unique id.

Next line we send a message to the client with the event name `Login` and a json message which sends the user`s unique id.

Event name must be implemented at the client side.

*tip: `UniqueId` automatically generated. and `Users` will automatically be added to the users list.*

After this, we will join user to a room and start playing the game

Add a new listener and name it `JoinAsync`.

```csharp
private async Task JoinAsync(string data, TcpClient client)
{
  Var user = UserManager.FindUser(client);
 
  var result = await RoomManager.JoinAsync(user);
 
  if (!result)
  {
      var room = new MyRoom(4);
      room.UsersCount = new TcpServerKit.Core.Range(2);
      await room.AddUserAsync(user);
  }
  else
  {
      Server.Send(user, "Join", string.Empty);
  }
}
```

In the first line we find the user with his client.

Next line we will join the user to a random room and it returns `true` value if the user joins successfully.

Next line, if the result is false create a new room and then join the user to it. Number **4** means the number of rounds of the game we're going to play.

*tip: the default round value is **2**.*

Next line we specify how many users can join this room. it can be a fixed value or a range of values.

```csharp
room.UsersCount = new TcpServerKit.Core.Range(2, 4);
```

Next line we add the user to the room.

After that `NewUserJoinedAsync` task will be run.

```csharp
public override Task NewUserJoinedAsync(User user)
{
  Console.WriteLine($"New user with UniqueId{user.UniqueId} joined.");
  return Task.CompletedTask;
}
```

After that all users join the room `RoomReadyForStartAsync` task will be run.

```csharp
public override Task RoomReadyForStartAsync(List<User> users)
{
    Console.WriteLine("RoomReadyForStart");
    return Task.CompletedTask;
}
```

if we specify users count as a ranged value, in the previous example our range is between `2` and `4`. If users who join to room are `3` or `2`, we can start the game but the room is not full yet. For that we can check if all users joined the room with `AllUsersJoined`.

It returns `true` if all users joined and the room is full of users.

```csharp
if (Room.AllUsersJoined)
{
    Console.WriteLine("All user joined.");
}
```
